# GeniusLyricsScraper

## What does it do?
Finds lyrics of your favourite songs, scrapes it from [genius.com](https://genius.com/) and prints it to your terminal.

## Motivation
After the kitten scraper, I wanted to build something a little more practical which I could see my friends actually using.
Hence the lyrics scraper.
